   - `vmw_icons.vssx` (icons)
   - `vmw_colors.vssx` (colors and boxes)
3. Open the template (`*.vstm`) in Visio.

## Do’s and Don’ts

| **Do** | **Don’t** |
|--------|-----------|
| Use the **Metropolis** font for consistency | Use a font size smaller than **11 pt** |
| Create text blocks first to check layout fit | Scale icons or shapes—they may appear distorted |
| Ensure your design fits intended width before styling | Use non-standard paper formats, which may alter appearance |
