## Quick Start Guide

### Microsoft Visio (Windows)

1. Download and extract the `vmw_stencils-<release>.zip` archive.
2. Copy the following files to your Visio "My Shapes" folder:
   - `vmw_template.vstm` (template)
   - `vmw_icons.vssx` (icons)
   - `vmw_colors.vssx` (colors and boxes)
3. Open the template (`*.vstm`) in Visio.
4. In the Shapes pane, click **More Shapes** → **Open Stencil**, then select and open both stencil files.
5. You can now drag and drop stencil shapes onto your canvas to build diagrams.  

### OmniGraffle (macOS)

1. Download and extract the `vmw_stencils-<release>.zip` archive.
2. Locate the OmniGraffle Stencils folder:

~/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniGraffle7/Data/Library/Application Support/The Omni Group/OmniGraffle/Stencils

3. Create a new folder named `VMware` and copy in:
- `vmw_icons.gstencil` (icons)
- `vmw_color.gstencil` (colors and boxes)
4. Go to Finder → **Go** → **Go to Folder…**, and paste:

/Library/Colors

5. Copy `vmw.clr` (palette) into that folder.
6. Open OmniGraffle and access the stencils via the sidebar stencil icon.

## Do’s and Don’ts

| **Do** | **Don’t** |
|--------|-----------|
| Use the **Metropolis** font for consistency | Use a font size smaller than **11 pt** |
| Create text blocks first to check layout fit | Scale icons or shapes—they may appear distorted |
| Ensure your design fits intended width before styling | Use non-standard paper formats, which may alter appearance |
